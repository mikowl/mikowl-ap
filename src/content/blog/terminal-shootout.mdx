I'm a sucker for trying out new terminal emulators. They all pretty much do the same thing and to be honest the out of the box macOs is totes fine but I'm a nerd and collect terminals like pokemon cards. Here I'll go over some of the pros and cons of the most popular terminals out there.

## Hyper

<img src="/img/hyper.png" alt="Hyper terminal" class="w-full" />

[Hyper](https://hyper.is/) is a fresh and flashy terminal built on web technologies like Electron, React, and Redux. It's highly extensible, allowing you to customize and extend its functionality with plugins.

<div class="flex gap-6">
<div class="bg-[#4ade80] bg-opacity-20 basis-1/2 rounded-md px-4 py-2">
<h4>Pros:</h4>
  - Very easy to customize
  - Looks pretty pretty out of the box
</div>
<div class="bg-[#f87171] bg-opacity-20 basis-1/2 rounded-md px-4 py-2">
<h4>Cons:</h4>
  - Performance can be sluggish (although it's gotten better in v3)
</div>
</div>

## iTerm2

<img src="/img/iterm.png" alt="iTerm2 terminal" class="w-full" />

[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) is a tried and true macOS terminal emulator, known for its extensive features and customization options. I used iTerm2 for many many years and never had any issues with it.

<div class="flex gap-6">
<div class="bg-[#4ade80] bg-opacity-20 basis-1/2 rounded-md px-4 py-2">
<h4>Pros:</h4>
  - Built-in support for tabs, split panes, and more
  - Mature and well-maintained
</div>
<div class="bg-[#f87171] bg-opacity-20 basis-1/2 rounded-md px-4 py-2">
<h4>Cons:</h4>
  - macOS only
  - Probably your dad's terminal
</div>
</div>

## Alacritty

<img src="/img/alacritty.png" alt="Alacritty terminal" class="w-full rounded-md max-w-[96%] mx-auto shadow-lg" />

[Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) is a <span><Tooltip client:visible content="lol it really is tho ðŸš€">blazingly-fast</Tooltip></span>, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that values simplicity and performance above all else. It has somewhat of a cult following, kinda like the arch linux of terminal emulators. Like if you ask "Which terminal do you use?" on twitter, the alacritty folks pop out of the woodworks.

<div class="flex gap-6">
<div class="bg-[#4ade80] bg-opacity-20 basis-1/2 rounded-md px-4 py-2">
<h4>Pros:</h4>
  - Probably the fastest terminal in this list
  - Cross-platform
</div>
<div class="bg-[#f87171] bg-opacity-20 basis-1/2 rounded-md px-4 py-2">
<h4>Cons:</h4>
  - Limited customization and features compared to other terminals
  - Emoji and ligature support is not great
</div>
</div>

## Kitty

<img src="/img/kitty.png" alt="Kitty terminal" class="w-full rounded-md max-w-[96%] mx-auto shadow-lg" />

[Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) is another GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that aims to strike a balance between performance and features. This has been my personal favorite terminal for a while now, it's almost as fast as alacritty and really just looked super nice out of the box without having to fuss with it too much.

<div class="flex gap-6">
<div class="bg-[#4ade80] bg-opacity-20 basis-1/2 rounded-md px-4 py-2">
<h4>Pros:</h4>
  - Fast and efficient
  - Rich in features, such as ligature support and image rendering
</div>
<div class="bg-[#f87171] bg-opacity-20 basis-1/2 rounded-md px-4 py-2">
<h4>Cons:</h4>
  - Tad more complex configuration compared to Alacritty
  - Logo is lame [but you can change it](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/faq/#i-do-not-like-the-kitty-icon)
  - Copying text can be wonky sometimes
</div>
</div>

## Tabby

<img src="/img/tabby.png" alt="Tabby terminal" class="w-full" />

[Tabby](https://tabby.sh/) is a modern and extensible terminal emulator that emphasizes user experience and productivity. It offers some cool features like "Smart tabs" that can detect progress and notify when a process is done. It also has a built in quake mode which is rad.

<div class="flex gap-6">
<div class="bg-[#4ade80] bg-opacity-20 basis-1/2 rounded-md px-4 py-2">
<h4>Pros:</h4>
  - Beautiful and user-friendly interface
  - Extensible with plugins
</div>
<div class="bg-[#f87171] bg-opacity-20 basis-1/2 rounded-md px-4 py-2">
<h4>Cons:</h4>
  - Performance might not be as fast as GPU-accelerated terminals
</div>
</div>

## Warp

<img src="/img/warp.png" alt="Warp terminal" class="w-full" />

[Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) is a cloud-powered terminal emulator that enables real-time collaboration and seamless integration with cloud services. They state "Writing code in your terminal shouldnâ€™t feel like 1978" but part of my favorite thing about terminals are the 1978 vibes. I can't be alone in this right? Anyways, it's cool and there are a shitton of features but it's not for me. 

<div class="flex gap-6">
<div class="bg-[#4ade80] bg-opacity-20 basis-1/2 rounded-md px-4 py-2">
<h4>Pros:</h4>
  - Fully native, built with Rust
  - Real-time collaboration features
  - Tons of features
</div>
<div class="bg-[#f87171] bg-opacity-20 basis-1/2 rounded-md px-4 py-2">
<h4>Cons:</h4>
  - Reliance on the cloud can raise security and privacy concerns
  - Almost too many features
  - Not open source
  - macOs only
</div>
</div>

## Terminal (macOS)

<img src="/img/terminal.png" alt="macOS terminal" class="w-full" />

The macOS default Terminal is a reliable and straightforward terminal emulator that gets the job done. I hadn't opened this up in forever, aw I kinda miss it. I still have a tmux session running, which I really only used for split screens so stopped using it since kitty has built in split screen functionality.

<div class="flex gap-6">
<div class="bg-[#4ade80] bg-opacity-20 basis-1/2 rounded-md px-4 py-2">
<h4>Pros:</h4>
  - Pre-installed on macOS
  - Simple and reliable
</div>
<div class="bg-[#f87171] bg-opacity-20 basis-1/2 rounded-md px-4 py-2">
<h4>Cons:</h4>
  - Limited features and customization options compared to other terminals
</div>
</div>

Dangggg did you know there were so many terminal emulators out there? I think I'll be sticking with Kitty, the [layouts](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/layouts/#the-tall-layout) are great, it's fast, and it's pretty. Which one is your favorite? Let me know on [twitter](https://twitter.com/mikowl).
