Shortly after writing about various [css-in-js solutions](/posts/exploring-css-solutions-for-react), Meta released their own solution called [StyleX](https://stylexjs.com/) that looks pretty, pretty, pretty good.

## What Makes StyleX Stand Out?

  - **Atomic CSS**: It transforms styles into atomic CSS class names, eliminating the need for managing utility classes.
  - **Performance**: The Babel plugin ensures fast compile times, and the runtime is optimized for combining class name strings efficiently.
  - **Scalability**: Tailored for large codebases, StyleX minimizes CSS bundle sizes and ensures that styles encapsulate well, even in complex applications.
  - **Deterministic**: By managing CSS specificity, StyleX guarantees no conflicts between generated rules.
  - **Composability**: Styles can be easily merged across components, with predictable outcomes.
  - **Type Safety**: Full typing in TypeScript or Flow ensures that components accept only the styles they are supposed to.
  - **Colocation**: Styles can be authored in the same file as components, enhancing readability and maintainability.

Let's take a look at a basic example:

```jsx
const styles = stylex.create({
  base: {
    color: 'cornflowerBlue',
    fontSize: 69,
  },
  active: {
    color: 'papayaWhip',
  },
});
```

You define styles using `stylex.create`. I like this, it looks simple and familiar enough. Let's take a look at a more complex example:

```jsx
const DARK_MODE = "@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)"

const s = stylex.create({
  body: {
    fontFamily: 'sans-serif',
    fontSize: '1rem',
    backgroundColor: {
      default: "white",
      [DARK_MODE]: "black",
    },
    color: {
      default: "black",
      [DARK_MODE]: "white",
    },
  }
})
```

In this example we store the dark mode media query in a variable and set it as a condition with the style values.

To apply the styles we use `stylex.props`:

```jsx
<body {...stylex.props(s.body)}>
  <div
    {...stylex.props(
      styles.base,
      props.isActive && styles.active,
    )}
  />
</body>
```

## Conclusion

There's [much more](https://stylexjs.com/docs/learn/) StyleX can do but I just wanted to give a quick overview. I'm excited to see how it evolves and how it compares to other solutions.
