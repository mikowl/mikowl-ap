## Console Ninja

[Console Ninja](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.console-ninja) displays console.log output and runtime errors directly in your editor from your running browser or node application. It's like your browser dev tools console tab or terminal output from your node app, but instead of having to context switch, values are connected to your code and displayed ergonomically in your editor.


## CSS Var Complete

[CSS Var Complete](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=phoenisx.cssvar) provides autocompletion IntelliSense for globally shared CSS Variables and more. It's super handy, you just type -- and you will get a dropdown with all of your CSS variables.

## Scratchpads

[Scratchpads](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=buenon.scratchpads) allows you to create 'scratchpads', it's a super simple idea but I find myself using it all the time. Anytime I stumble across a cool [CSS](/posts/) or [JS](/posts/) snippet I pop open the scratchpad so I can reference it later.

## Error Lens

[Error Lens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens) will highlight errors in your code and show you the error message in the editor. It's a great way to catch errors before you run your code. It's extremely flexible so you can make it as obtrusive or unobtrusive as you want.


## Vim

I have to mention the [Vim](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) extension for VSCode, if I could only choose one extension it'd have to be this. I have way too many years of vim muscle memory.

## Tailwind CSS IntelliSense

[Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) provides class name completion for Tailwind CSS classes in your markup. This was an absolute lifesaver when I first started learning Tailwind. If you're new to Tailwind you can  pretty much guesstimate the class name and then hit ctrl + space to see all of the options. This saved so much time from having to bring up the docs.

## Headwind

[Headwind](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind) is a Tailwind CSS class sorter. It will sort your classes in the order that Tailwind recommends. It's really nice  to have your Tailwind classes automatically sorted on save.


## Github Copilot

What can I say, [Github Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) is getting real good. I've been using it for about 6 months now and it's hard to imagine coding without it. Don't let it write code for you or replace your brain, instead let it do the busy work so you can focus on the important stuff. Don't forget you are the pilot, learn how to utilize and stear it and it can be an incredibly powerful tool.
