import Pokeball from '../../components/img/Pokeball';

I wanted to create a simple game with my daughter to get the programming wheels turning in her head. It started as a card memory matching game and grew into an actually kinda fun game. There are 9 total rounds for each Pokemon generation, at the end of each round you are shown the Pokemon you just caught. You then have a chance to earn a "power up" by guessing which of those would win in a battle (this is based on a simple calculation of the sum of their stats). The powerups could be:
<ul style="list-style:none;line-height:1;">
	<li><Pokeball fill="#f8d878" /> reveal power (temporarily reveals all the cards)</li>
	<li><Pokeball fill="#6844fc" /> turn power (takes away 2 turns)</li>
	<li><Pokeball fill="#e40058" /> time power (takes 7 seconds off the clock)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Tech used:</strong> [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), [Preact](https://preactjs.com/), [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest), [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/), hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

You can play the game [here](https://pokematch.vercel.app/) or view the source code [here](https://github.com/mikowl/pokematch).
