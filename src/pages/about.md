My name is Michael Elias, I currently reside in California with my lovely wife, 2 beautiful daughters, and a great dane name Kevin.

I have experience with a large [array] of technologies old and new but recently have been specializing in Shopify development and headless e-commerce sites. I am currently a senior front end engineer at Nordic Naturals, a large vitamins & supplements company where I help drive the company's goals and develop new features.
