They all pretty much do the same thing and to be honest the out of the box macOs is totes fine but I'm a nerd and collect terminals like pokemon cards. Here I'll go over some of the pros and cons of the most popular terminals out there.\n\n## Hyper\n\n<img src=\"/img/hyper.png\" alt=\"Hyper terminal\" class=\"w-full\" />\n\n[Hyper](https://hyper.is/) is a fresh and flashy terminal built on web technologies like Electron, React, and Redux. It's highly extensible, allowing you to customize and extend its functionality with plugins.\n\n<div class=\"pros-cons flex gap-10\">\n<div>\n#### Pros:\n  - Very easy to customize\n  - Looks pretty pretty out of the box\n</div>\n<div>\n#### Cons:\n  - Performance can be sluggish (although it's gotten better in v3)\n</div>\n</div>\n\n## iTerm2\n\n<img src=\"/img/iterm.png\" alt=\"iTerm2 terminal\" class=\"w-full\" />\n\n[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) is a tried and true macOS terminal emulator, known for its extensive features and customization options. I used iTerm2 for many many years and never had any issues with it.\n\n<div class=\"pros-cons flex gap-10\">\n<div>\n#### Pros:\n  - Built-in support for tabs, split panes, and more\n  - Mature and well-maintained\n</div>\n<div>\n#### Cons:\n  - macOS only\n  - Probably your dad's terminal\n</div>\n</div>\n\n## Alacritty\n\n<img src=\"/img/alacritty.png\" alt=\"Alacritty terminal\" class=\"w-full rounded-md max-w-[96%] mx-auto shadow-lg\" />\n\n[Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/) is a <span><Tooltip client:visible content=\"lol it really is tho ðŸš€\">blazingly-fast</Tooltip></span>, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that values simplicity and performance above all else. It has somewhat of a cult following, kinda like the arch linux of terminal emulators. Like if you ask \"Which terminal do you use?\" on twitter, the alacritty folks pop out of the woodworks.\n\n<div class=\"pros-cons flex gap-10\">\n<div>\n#### Pros:\n  - Probably the fastest terminal in this list\n  - Cross-platform\n</div>\n<div>\n#### Cons:\n  - Limited customization and features compared to other terminals\n  - Emoji and ligature support is not great\n</div>\n</div>\n\n## Kitty\n\n<img src=\"/img/kitty.png\" alt=\"Kitty terminal\" class=\"w-full rounded-md max-w-[96%] mx-auto shadow-lg\" />\n\n[Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) is another GPU-accelerated terminal emulator that aims to strike a balance between performance and features. This has been my personal favorite terminal for a while now, it's almost as fast as alacritty and really just looked super nice out of the box without having to fuss with it too much.\n\n<div class=\"pros-cons flex gap-10\">\n<div>\n#### Pros:\n  - Fast and efficient\n  - Rich in features, such as ligature support and image rendering\n</div>\n<div>\n#### Cons:\n  - Tad more complex configuration compared to Alacritty\n  - Logo is lame [but you can change it](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/faq/#i-do-not-like-the-kitty-icon)\n  - Copying text can be wonky sometimes\n</div>\n</div>\n\n## Tabby\n\n<img src=\"/img/tabby.png\" alt=\"Tabby terminal\" class=\"w-full\" />\n\n[Tabby](https://tabby.sh/) is a modern and extensible terminal emulator that emphasizes user experience and productivity. It offers some cool features like \"Smart tabs\" that can detect progress and notify when a process is done. It also has a built in quake mode which is rad.\n\n<div class=\"pros-cons flex gap-10\">\n<div>\n#### Pros:\n  - Beautiful and user-friendly interface\n  - Extensible with plugins\n</div>\n<div>\n#### Cons:\n  - Performance might not be as fast as GPU-accelerated terminals\n</div>\n</div>\n\n## Warp\n\n<img src=\"/img/warp.png\" alt=\"Warp terminal\" class=\"w-full\" />\n\n[Warp](https://www.warp.dev/) is a cloud-powered terminal emulator that enables real-time collaboration and seamless integration with cloud services. They state \"Writing code in your terminal shouldnâ€™t feel like 1978\" but part of my favorite thing about terminals are the 1978 vibes. I can't be alone in this right? Anyways, it's cool and there are a shitton of features but it's not for me. \n\n<div class=\"pros-cons flex gap-10\">\n<div>\n#### Pros:\n  - Fully native, built with Rust\n  - Real-time collaboration features\n  - Tons of features\n</div>\n<div>\n#### Cons:\n  - Reliance on the cloud can raise security and privacy concerns\n  - Almost too many features\n  - Not open source\n  - macOs only\n</div>\n</div>\n\n## Terminal (macOS)\n\n<img src=\"/img/terminal.png\" alt=\"macOS terminal\" class=\"w-full\" />\n\nThe macOS default Terminal is a reliable and straightforward terminal emulator that gets the job done. I hadn't opened this up in forever, aw I kinda miss it. I still have a tmux session running, which I really only used for split screens so stopped using it since kitty has built in split screen functionality.\n\n<div class=\"pros-cons flex gap-10\">\n<div>\n#### Pros:\n  - Pre-installed on macOS\n  - Simple and reliable\n</div>\n<div>\n#### Cons:\n  - Limited features and customization options compared to other terminals\n</div>\n</div>\n\nDangggg did you know there were so many terminal emulators out there? I think I'll be sticking with Kitty, the [layouts](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/layouts/#the-tall-layout) are great, it's fast, and it's pretty. Which one is your favorite?
